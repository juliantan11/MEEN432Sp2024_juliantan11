This week 1 assignment was done as a group effort by Cameron Pinkerton, Hunter Aschen, and Julian Tan
For our Matlab Code, we had the all the initial conditions coded so that we could adjust it for our Simulink model. The time steps and solver were coded as an array. The for loops in the code makes it so that everytime
a fixed time step was chosen with the solver, it would plot the angular acceleration and velocity for that respective time step and solver, and continue for each variable in the array till all variables were plotted. 
The deliverables did not specify if we needed to plot angular velocity and acceleration for all time steps and solver but I included it in our code and can readjust for week 2 if we do not need it. 

## Week 1 Feedback (5/5):

Great job guys! Keep it up for week 2, ya'll are on track! Only suggestion would be to now look into logic on how you can determine if your applied torque is constant, or sinusoidal.
