'Running the matlabe code titled "Project1Final", the "Part 1" code runs to the Simulink model 
titled "Project1Part1_". This first part outputs the values of dt, rotational speed, and CPU time
for the fixed step solvers "ode1" and "ode4". Plots for "Max Error v. Time Step" and "CPU Time v. Time
Step" are outputted for the fixed time step solvers. A plot of "Max Error v. CPU Time" is also produced
for all of the solvers. The "Part 2" code runs to the Simulink model titled "Project1Part2_". This
section of the code outputs a plot of "Shaft Speed v. Time" for all three of the solvers.'
