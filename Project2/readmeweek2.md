The simulink provided has been modified to input psi real from other components of the model, calculate psi desired, and import car data specs. We then proceeded to code the path of the driver utilizing the psi desired and psi real parameters so that the driver would follow the track.

## Week 2 Feedback (4.4/5)
There were some errors in the MATLAB script that made it unable to run. Looking through the model, it seems that the incorrect radius is being used in the driver model. The carData.radius value corresponds to the radius of the wheels. The radius you want to use is that of the track on the curved sections. For the final submission, continue to work through the Simulink model and tweaking it so that you are able to stay on track and go around the track as fast as possible. Now that you have the Simulink model, you can animate the rectangular patch from week 1 using the car simulation data and animate the vehicle going around the race track. The team will also need to utilize the raceStat function somewhere in the MATLAB script to see how many loops the vehicle is able to do and to see information regarding the vehicle leaving the track.
