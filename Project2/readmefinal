This week, the group began by debugging our week 2 code to work properly. The main issue found was turns 3 and 4 causing issues and we debugged until the code ran correctly. When moving to week 3, we created code that relays the driver's telemetry data as the car goes around the track. This data relays information like the time to complete each lap, how many laps were completed, and if the car ever goes off the track. After debugging week 2, we were able to get the track to work properly, but for week 3, the completed loops were not being output properly. Hunter worked on the coding, Julien worked on the Simulink model, and Cameron worked with both and helped where possible and completed the read me.
