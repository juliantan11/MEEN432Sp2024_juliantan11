The code labeled Project2Week1 builds a race track that is modeled as a 900 meter long and two turns at a 200 meter radius. Executing the code builds the track in a figure as well as plots a path that the car will follow. Along this path, the car is pictured as a blue square and is plotted in the middle of the car path.
