The code labeled Project2Week1 builds a race track that is modeled as a 900 meter long and two turns at a 200 meter radius. Executing the code builds the track in a figure as well as plots a path that the car will follow. Along this path, the car is pictured as a blue square and is plotted in the middle of the car path.

## Week 1 Feedback (4.4/5)
The vehicle patch did not rotate it's heading at the curved sections of the track. The vehicle needs to be able to turn with the track and straightenback at the straightaways. For Week 2, start developing a lateral dynamic model of a vehicle that contains subsystems that are listed in the Week 2 document.
