To begin our progress, a team member downloaded and applied the EPA Urban and Highway cycles data into the provided model. From the demo in class, this was approximately all that was needed to complete the deliverables from the project. All team members contributed to this process. The final model can be found under Project3-week1_.slx under the project 3 file in this github repository.
