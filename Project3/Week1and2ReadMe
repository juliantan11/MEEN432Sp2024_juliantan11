To begin our progress, a team member downloaded and applied the EPA Urban and Highway cycles data into the provided model. From the demo in class, this was approximately all that was needed to complete the deliverables from the project. All team members contributed to this process. The final model can be found under Project3-week1_.slx under the Project 3 file in this github repository. Moving onto week 2, the team took the output from the week 1 model and code mentioned before. This output is used to give an estimate of the overall vehicle energy usage using a single-speed transmission. This is done by taking the wheel torque out of the powertrain module and multiplying it by the angular velocity. To run the file, you must first run the initialization code and run whatever drive cycle is desired. You can verify that the drive cycle selected ran correctly by clicking on the output graphs.
