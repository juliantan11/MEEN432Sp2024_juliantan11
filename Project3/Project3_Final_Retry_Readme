The longitudinal simulation model created was cordinated with a simple driver to drive the vehicle for both the EPA Urban and Highway cycles provided. A powertrain subsystem was integrated into this model with an electric motor subsystem and a single speed transmission. The energy consumed by this system can be seen after the simulation is run as simout.MotorEnergy. The power generated by this system can also be seen in the simout data as simout.MotorPower. A battery system was then applied to the model as well as a regenerative braking application. Lastly, the code outputs a graph of the simulation drive data versus the real drive data from the EPA drive schedules. 
To run our code and model, the first thing that must be done is downloading the matlab filed "Finalinit", "DriveCycleinit", and "Project3_Final_Retry". The simulink model "Project3_Final_Retry_" must then be downloaded. The first object to run is the "Finalinit" initialization file. Next the drive schedules must be initialized by running the "DriveCycleinit" file. Lastly the "Project3_Final_Retry" file must be run and this will output all of the graphs for the drive schedules and the data from the simulation.
